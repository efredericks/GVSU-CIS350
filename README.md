## Learning Objectives

Software Engineering of computer-based information systems deals with technologies, notations, tools, and procedures to improve both the process of software development and the resulting products. Software requirements analysis, design, testing, and metrics are emphasized.  Please take note: this course no longer satisfies the SWS (Supplemental Writing Skills) requirement and is not an SWS course. 

Specifically, students will:
* Describe the phases, activities, advantages, and limitations of major software development life cycle models.
* Be able to learn and apply requirements, analysis, and design techniques.
* Use UML diagrams to specify static and dynamic aspects of software systems.
* Apply project management techniques and tools (such as COCOMO, Earned Value Analysis) to estimate effort, schedule, and measure project progress indicators.
* Apply black-box and white-box software testing techniques.
* Demonstrate an understanding of social, legal, ethical, and global issues in computing.
* Write a technical report utilizing consistent formatting and citation guidelines.

## Lecture

Class meets 3 times a week in person.  Typically class will comprise a lecture with some in-class assignments sprinkled throughout.  These are due the **next day by 11:59pm**.  Ensure you keep up on these, as they factor into the Participation part of your grade.  

**Note**: I will not accept late in-class assignment submissions - no exceptions.
